        If you choose "Add a new project", you should specifies the unique Project Name
        that you want to created and published to. If the same name project is existed, the plugin
        will use the same name's project.
        For example: jenkins_test_project

        If you use Pipeline job, you could also use ${env.JOB_NAME} instead of specify manually.
